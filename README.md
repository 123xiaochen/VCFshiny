# WGS-shiny
WGS-shiny,an R shiny application that can be launched easily from a local web browser for analyzing Whole Genomes Sequenced VCF data or Annovar annotation TXT data. This application is started from data input, then through select display input data and General Analyse, Extension Analyse. General Analyse include Snp + Indel Variants summarise, Snp Heatmap Analyse, Snp All Variants Type summarise, Snp or Indel Cross-analysis was repeated for each sample, Snp or Indel circos plot analyse. Extension Analyse require input data must through Annovar annotation, which include Statistical analysis of Snp or Indel Variants Position distribution, Statistical analysis of mutation genes in each samples, Statistical heat map analysis of mutant genes in each samples, GO/KEGG enrichment analysis of mutant genes in each samples. WGS-shiny provides a clear analysis flow and a user-friendly GUI interface but keeps the most important parameters of involved functions, which suit both non-programming experiences and researchers and expert bioinformatics researchers. User can accomplish a standard WGS Analyse in hours depending on the size of their dataset.
