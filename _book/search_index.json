Modern DNA sequencing began in 1977 with the development of chemical sequencing by Maxam and Gilbert (A.M. Maxam, W. Gilbert. 1977) and dideoxy sequencing by Sanger, Nicklen and Coulson, as well as the first complete DNA sequence (phage rX174) (Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR. 1977), demonstrating that sequencing can provide profound insights into genetic organization. Incremental improvements allowed the sequencing of 200 kb (human cytomegalovirus) molecules, which produced a huge amount of data that required computational analysis and gave rise to the field of bioinformatics (Hutchison,CA,3rd. 2007).These labor-intensive processes contributed to the first human genome project, taking over a decade and costing $2.7 billion to complete (NHGRI). 1.1.1.1 Sanger sequencing Figure 1.1: Sanger_Sequencing Nearly 25 years after the structure of DNA was discovered, the first method for sequencing DNA was published (Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR. 1977). This method involved the addition of chain-terminating and radioactively labeled (earlier approach) or fluorescently labeled (later approach) dideoxy nucleotides to perform sequencing of a DNA strand complementary to the interrogated template strand. The fragments were then size separated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis to determine the sequence. Known as Sanger-sequencing, the method continued to improve with the introduction of capillary electrophoresis and gained wide acceptance as a “first-generation sequencing” method to sequence small and large genomes from bacteria and phages, to humans. Given that only one sequencing reaction could be analyzed at a time, the method was of limited throughput. Sequencing of diploid DNA also complicated the discernment of haploid sequences critical to many diagnostic and investigative purposes, necessitating subcloning, plating, and DNA preparation of individual subclones before sequencing (Hu T, Chitnis N, Monos D, Dinh A. 2021). 1.1.1.2 Human Genome Project Figure 1.2: Human_Genome_Project) In 1984 scientists from United States Energy Departmentmet to discuss a project that would devise a technique to sequence the human genome. The aim was to launch studies to detect mutations in DNAs from Second World War survivors of the atomic bomb in Japan. Researchers from the National Institute of Health in the United States quickly joined the group and James Watson was designated to head the Human Genome Research Institute, which became National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in 1989. Later, several countries joined the effort, particularly the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Canada, Germany and China and it became an international public consortium coordinated by the Human Genome Organization (Venter,J.C (2007)) 1.1.1.3 Next Generation Sequencing Technologic Figure 1.3: Next_Generation_Sequencing Between 2004 and 2006 “next-generation sequencing (NGS)” technologies were introduced, which transformed biomedical inquiry and resulted in a dramatic increase in sequencing dataoutput (S. Levy, et. 2007). The significant increase in data output was due to the nanotechnology principles and innovations that allowed massively parallel sequencing of single DNA molecules. The combined features of high throughput and single-molecule DNA sequencing are hallmarks of NGS, irrespective of the sequencing platform. The technology’s evolved procedures were better merged with data acquisition and analysis, freeing the community from more labor-intensive and low-efficiency historical Sanger sequencing approaches and facilitating an extraordinary increase in data output. Second-generation approaches, such as on the Illumina or Ion Torrent platforms, generally start with DNA fragmentation, DNA end-repair, adapter ligation, surface attachment, and in-situ amplification. These “short-read” sequencing technologies involve the massively parallel sequencing of short reads, whereby millions of individual sequencing reactions occur in parallel. However, by nature of being short-read technologies, sequencing data over long stretches of DNA must be reassembled, presenting challenges with structural variations or low-complexity regions (Hu T, Chitnis N, Monos D, Dinh A. 2021). 1.1.2 Whole Genomic Sequencing Explosive advances in next-generation sequencer (NGS) and computational analyses handling massive data have enabled us to comprehensively analyze cancer genome profiles at research and clinical levels, such as targeted sequencing for hundreds of genes, whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS)(Nakagawa H,et. 2015). WGS approaches can cover all of these unexplored mutations and help us to better understand the “whole” landscape of cancer genomes and elucidate the functions of these unexplored human genomic regions. This approach combined with mathematical analysis and other omics analysis can clarify the underlying carcinogenesis and achieve molecular sub-classification of cancer, which facilitates discovery of genomic biomarkers and personalized cancer medicine (Nakagawa H, Fujita M. 2018). 1.1.3 Research Significance Data analysis of whole genome sequencing requires a bioinformatics background and programming skills that are difficult for most researchers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop interactive whole-genome data analysis tools that do not depend on programming languages. Based on the Web page framework provided by the R language shiny package and combined with the completed analysis process, this topic constructs a Web interactive analysis tool for the whole genome data, so as to enable more researchers to quickly and simply complete the whole genome data analysis. 1.2 How to start In this tutorial, we will go through the installation and usage of each module step by step using the example dataset we provided at github: https://github.com/123xiaochen/VCFshiny. 1.2.1 Requirement R (&gt;= 4.2.0) Shiny (&gt;= 1.6.0) 1.2.2 How to install shiny packsge Open R.

Install and run VCFshiny by the following commands in R: #Install VCFshiny install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) devtools::install_github(&quot;123xiaochen/VCFshiny&quot;) #Run VCFshiny library(shiny) library(VCFshiny) VCFshiny::startVCFshiny() Run VCFshiny: Figure 1.4: File-Format The first model of VCFshiny setting page will pop-up (Figure 1.4). "],["prepare-data.html", "Chapter 2 Prepare data 2.1 Source of VCF input data 2.2 Source of TXT input data 2.3 Input Data name requirements 2.4 Example data set in VCFshiny software", " Chapter 2 Prepare data In this chapter, we describe how to prepare two different input datasets, where the annotation part of VCFshiny can only input unannotated VCF files, and the analysis part of VCFshiny can read annotated VCF and TXT files. 2.1 Source of VCF input data The Variant Call Format (VCF) is used to record gene sequence variations. It is also the first file format to be understood for genome population correlation analysis. The file is divided into two main parts: the Header comment section, which begins with #, and the body section. 2.2 Source of TXT input data TXT file is one of the standard storage formats after mutation data annotation. Because some users cannot annotate the steps, We provide Annovar (Wang K, Li M, Hakonarson H. 2010) and VariantAnnotation (Obenchain, V., et al. 2014) two methods of annotation in the VCFshiny, Users can choose to annotate themselves or use the tool. 2.3 Input Data name requirements 2.3.1 Input file name requirements Figure 2.1: File-Format The first box represents the sample name, which can be the group of experiments and the number of repetitions, connected by the character “-” or *“_“*. The second box represents the data type, which can be snp or indel data. When snp and indel are not classified in the data, this box is not necessary. The third box represents the data format, which can be vcf files, vcf. gz compressed files, and Annovar annotated TXT files. The contents of the three boxes are connected by “.”. 2.3.2 Input compress files requirements Before uploading the data to VCFshiny, that needs to be compressed. The following are the naming requirements for the compressed folder. Figure 2.2: Fold_Format The compressed file name must be the same as the name of the compressed folder. The compressed file can be in *.tar.gz or *.zip format. 2.4 Example data set in VCFshiny software We provide a built-in dataset that can be used to explore VCFshiny. The data set can be directly loaded into the APP by clicking the button “Use example data?” of the data input module (Figure S4-II). The built-in dataset was derived from the sequencing data of published articles, including a control group and three experimental groups, with three replicates in each group (Liang Y, Xie J, Zhang Q, et al. 2022). The sequencing data was first mapping to the reference, followed by gatk Variants calling and Annovar annotations.

Figure 3.14: Cancer_Dirver_Genes 3.2 Part 2: Annotation Part VCFshiny not only provides analysis of mutated data after annotation, but also provides user friendly annotation features. VCFshiny provides two kinds of software, Annovar and VariantAnnotation, to annotate VCF files. After downloading the annotation results, they can be uploaded directly to the analysis part for analysis. 3.2.1 Module 1: Annovar Annotation ANNOVAR (Wang K, Li M, Hakonarson H. 2010) is an efficient software tool for functional annotation of genetic variation detected in the genome using up-to-date information. Given a list of chromosomal variants, starting positions, ending positions, reference nucleotides, and observed nucleotides, ANNOVAR can perform annotation in three ways: 1. Gene-based annotation: determines whether SNPs or CNVs cause protein coding changes and the affected amino acids. 2. Region-based annotation: Identifying variations in specific genomic regions. 3. Filter-based annotation: Identify variations of records in a particular database. The first Annotation tool provided by VCFshiny for mutate Data is Annovar. Users can annotate mutant data through “Annovar Annotation” module in the “Data Annotation” page (Figure 3.15-I), which includes two parts: (1) The first part is data uploading and annotation parameter setting. Users can upload their own variation data and select annotation type and annotation database according to requirements (Figure 3.15-II). (2) The second part is the display part of annotation results. After data upload and annotation, annotation results will be displayed in the form of a table in the second part. At the same time, the built-in download button enables users to download annotation results for further analysis (Figure 3.15-III). Figure 3.15: Annovar Annotation 3.2.2 Module 2: VariantAnnotation Annotation VariantAnnotation (Obenchain, V., et al. 2014) is an R / Bioconductor package for the exploration and annotation of genetic variants. Capabilities exist for reading, writing and filtering variant call format (VCF) files. The second Annotation tool provided by VCFshiny for variable Data is VariantAnnotation, which can be annotated by users in the “VariantAnnotation Annotation” module on the “Data Annotation” page (Figure 3.16-I), which includes two parts: (1) The first part is the reading of data and the selection of annotation parameters. Users can upload their own variation data and select annotation parameters for annotation (Figure 3.16-II). (2) The second part is the display part of annotation results. After data upload and annotation, annotation results will be displayed in the form of a table in the second part. At the same time, the built-in download button enables users to download annotation results for further analysis (Figure 3.16-III). Figure 3.16: VariantAnnotation Annotation 3.2.3 Module 3: Download Annovar Database Before using Annovar annotation in VCFshiny, required annotation Database needs to be downloaded. The “Download Annovar Database” module in the “Data Annotation” page of VCFshiny provides a convenient download page (Figure 3.17-I). Users can download the database in Annovar software according to their own needs. This page includes three parts: (1) Download parameter selection section. Users can select the type and name of the database to download according to their needs (Figure 3.17-II). (2) Download the display part of the database, after the completion of the database download, the current downloaded database is displayed (Figure 3.17-III). (3) The database name provided by Annovar. We will display the downloaded data provided by Annovar, and users can download the database according to the display information (Figure 3.17-IV). Figure 3.17: Download Annovar Database "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 4 Conclusion", " Chapter 4 Conclusion VCFshiny provides an easy-to-use framework for annotating and statistical analysis of VCF(variant call format) variant data after high-throughput sequencing analysis.
