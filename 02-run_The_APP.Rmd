  In this Chapter, we will introduce step by step instruction in each module using the example built-in dataset provided at WGS-shiny. After starting the WGS-Shiny , there are a Introduction page and nine modules: (1) Data Input; (2) Variants Numbers; (3) SNP Analysis; (4) Indel Analysis; (5) Venn Diagram; (6) Circos Plot; (7) Genomic Feature; (8) Highest Variants Genes and (9) Cancer Driver Genes on the left panel of WGS-Shiny(Figure S1). For question and bug report, please leave your comment under issue section at github page. Each analysis page includes the analysis method selection module on the left with black background and the analysis module on the right with white background. Click the analysis method in the selection module to enter each analysis page.

## Module 1: Data Input

  The purpose of the "Data Input" module is for users to input their own data or use the built-in data set. The data reading module consists of three parts: the data selection part on the left, the data display part on the right and the interpretation part of the built-in data below. Add the species selection button (Figure 3.2-I) in the data selection part, load the built-in data  button and read the data button (Figure 3.2-II), users can set the button according to their own data (Figure 3.2-III), and there is also a data upload button (Figure 3.2-IV). Sample selection button (Figure 3.2-V) is set in data display section, users can select samples for display.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Data_Input", out.width="100%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/Input-page_1.png")
```

## Module 2: Variants Number

  After uploading the data input, the uploaded input will be automatically divided into SNP and Indel according to the group. The main purpose of the analysis on the second module “Variants Number” is to display the number of SNP and Indel. 
  
```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Variants_number", out.width="100%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/1.Variants_numbers_1.png")
```

  The analysis module mainly includes three parts. (1) The first part is the selection and setting part, including the selection of data and the setting of graph parameters. At the same time, the transmission command window of ggplot graph command is added to the additional parameters (Figure 3.3-I and Figure 3.4 A-B). (2) The second part is to display the visual results. The drop-down box of the download button is built in the upper right corner of the page, so that users can download the visual results (Figure 3.3-II and Figure 3.4-C). (3) The third part is data display. The upper right corner of this page is built to select the data button, so that users can output the data according to their own needs (Figure 3.4-III and Figure-D).
