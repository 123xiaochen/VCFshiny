# Conclusion

WGS-shiny offers an easy-to-use framework for variant statistical analyses of mutation from genomes-wide data obtained from genomics sequencing. WGS-shiny can perform mutation statistical analysis for a variety of species, and users can analyze different data by selecting the species provided. Through the analytical testing of the test data, we believe that WGS-shiny can be a very useful tool in the field of whole gene analysis.
